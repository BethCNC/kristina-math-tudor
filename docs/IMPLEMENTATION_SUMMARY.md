### Phase 2: Content Audit & Missing Formulas ✅

#### T2.1: Chapter 6 - Personal Finance (REBUILT)
**Status:** ✅ Complete page rebuild with ALL missing formulas

**Added Formulas:**
- ✅ Simple Interest: I = Prt
- ✅ Compound Interest: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)
- ✅ **Annual Percentage Yield (APY):** APY = ((1 + r/n)^n - 1) × 100%
- ✅ **Present Value (PV):** PV = A / (1 + r/n)^(nt)
- ✅ **Future Value of Annuity:** FV = PMT × [((1 + r/n)^(nt) - 1) / (r/n)]
- ✅ **Payment Amount (Annuity):** PMT = FV × [r/n / ((1 + r/n)^(nt) - 1)]
- ✅ **Loan Payment Amount:** PMT = (P × r/n) / (1 - (1 + r/n)^(-nt))
- ✅ **Maximum Purchase Price:** Max Price = PMT × [(1 - (1 + r/n)^(-nt)) / (r/n)]

**Content Includes:**
