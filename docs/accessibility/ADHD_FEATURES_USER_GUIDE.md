## 🆘 Common Questions

### "Why is there a 'Focus' button in the corner?"
That's Focus Mode! It hides distractions. Try it when you need to concentrate.

### "What are these pop-up messages?"
Those are achievements! They celebrate when you complete sections. They disappear automatically or you can click the X.

### "Will I lose my progress if I close the app?"
Nope! Everything saves automatically to your browser. You can close and come back anytime.

### "Can I turn off the break reminders?"
Right now they appear every 15 minutes. You can always click "Continue Learning" to skip them.

### "My text looks weird/too big/too small"
Click the "Aa" icon (top-left) and use the controls to adjust it. Click "Reset" if you want to go back to normal.

## 🎨 Color System (What the Colors Mean)

The app uses colors consistently to help you process information faster:

- 🟢 **Green** = Success, completed, good to go
- 🔴 **Red** = Urgent, important, due soon
- 🟠 **Orange** = Warning, pay attention, coming up
- 🔵 **Blue** = Information, writing/English stuff
- ⚪ **Gray** = Neutral, not urgent, future

This means:
- Green badge = You finished this! ✅
- Red badge = This is due VERY soon! ⚠️
- Orange badge = This is coming up
- Gray badge = This is far away, don't stress yet

---

## 🎉 You've Got This!

Remember:
- **Progress, not perfection**
- **Your brain works differently, and that's okay**
- **These tools are here to HELP you, not judge you**
- **Take breaks when you need them**
- **Celebrate every win, no matter how small**

---

## 🐛 Something Not Working?

If a feature isn't working:

1. Try refreshing the page
2. Check if JavaScript is enabled in your browser
3. Try a different browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
4. Clear your browser cache if needed

Still stuck? That's okay! You can still use the app without these features - they're extras to make life easier.
