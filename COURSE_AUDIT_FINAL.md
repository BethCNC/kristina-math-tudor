## 🚨 CRITICAL GAPS FOUND

### Gap #1: Weekly Attendance Assignments
**Status:** ❌ NOT SHOWN IN APP  
**Impact:** HIGH - Worth 5% of grade  
**Fix Needed:** Add weekly attendance tracker  
**Frequency:** Weekly  
**Where to show:** Dashboard, calendar

### Gap #2: Hawkes Learning Assignments

**Impact:** CRITICAL - Worth 20% of MAT 143 grade  
**Fix Needed:** Add Hawkes due dates to each chapter page  
**Frequency:** Before each test (4 major deadlines)  
**Where to show:** Chapter pages, calendar, dashboard

### Gap #3: Lab Assignments
**Status:** ❌ NOT SHOWN IN APP  
**Impact:** HIGH - Worth 10% of grade  
**Fix Needed:** Add lab assignment tracker  
**Frequency:** Unknown - need syllabus details  
**Where to show:** Calendar, dashboard

### Gap #4: Signature Assignment

---

## 🎯 CRITICAL RECOMMENDATION FOR ADHD SUPPORT

### Current State: Tests & Essays Covered ✅
- All 4 MAT 143 tests: Dates correct, urgency clear
- All 4 ENG 111 essays: Dates correct, urgency clear

### Missing: **20% + 10% + 5% + 5% = 40% of MAT 143 Grade** ⚠️
Without Hawkes, labs, signature assignment, and attendance tracking:
- Student could pass all tests and still fail the course
- These "smaller" assignments add up to 40% of final grade
- Student needs visual reminders for these too

│─────────────────────────────────│

│ Chapters 6 & 7                  │
│ [Prepare Now]                   │
│─────────────────────────────────│
│ Essay 3: Nov 15 (8 days)        │
│ Analytical Essay                │
│ [Start Writing]                 │
│─────────────────────────────────│
│ Hawkes Ch 6: Nov 3              │
│ [Complete Assignment]           │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 📋 IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN

   - Chapters 4 & 5 Hawkes: Due before Sept 29

## ✅ WHAT'S WORKING WELL

### Visual Deadline System
- ✅ Color-coded urgency (red/orange/blue) is clear and consistent
- ✅ Test 3 and Essay 3 impossible to miss on dashboard
- ✅ Master deadline tracker (deadlines.html) shows full semester

### Navigation & Consistency
- ✅ All pages use professional-academic.css
- ✅ Same header/footer on every page
- ✅ Mobile navigation works well
- ✅ Breadcrumbs show current location

### Content Accuracy
- ✅ Test dates match syllabus exactly
- ✅ Essay dates match master list exactly
- ✅ Chapter coverage correct (1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 13 only)
- ✅ Essay requirements accurate (word counts, source requirements)

---

## 🎯 BOTTOM LINE

**Current Status:** 
- ✅ **Major assessments (tests + essays):** 100% accurate
- ⚠️ **Smaller assignments (Hawkes, labs, attendance):** Not shown
- ⚠️ **"Next Due" visibility:** Only on dashboard, not on every page

**For Student Success:**
The student can currently track Tests and Essays perfectly. However, for a student with ADHD retaking the course, the missing **40% of assignments** (Hawkes, labs, signature assignment, attendance) could cause failure even if they ace all tests and essays.

**Recommended Next Steps:**
1. **Add "Next Due" sticky widget to every page** (highest impact for ADHD support)
2. **Add Hawkes Learning due dates** (20% of grade!)
3. **Add attendance tracking** (easy to forget, 5% of grade)
4. **Verify ENG 111 syllabus** for any missing assignments

**Timeline:** 2-3 hours to implement all missing pieces and reach 100% course coverage.
