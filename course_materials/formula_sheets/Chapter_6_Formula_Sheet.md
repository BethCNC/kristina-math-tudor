# MAT 143 Chapter 6 Formula Sheet - Personal Finance

## Simple Interest Formula
**I = Prt**
- I = Interest earned
- P = Principal (starting amount)
- r = annual interest rate (as decimal)
- t = time in years

## Compound Interest
**A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)**
- A = Final amount
- P = Principal
- r = annual interest rate (as decimal)
- n = number of compounding periods per year
- t = time in years

### Compounding Frequencies:
- Annually: n = 1
- Semiannually: n = 2  
- Quarterly: n = 4
- Monthly: n = 12
- Weekly: n = 52
- Daily: n = 365

## Continuous Compound Interest Formula
**A = Pe^(rt)**

## Annual Percentage Yield (APY)
**APY = ((1 + r/n)^n - 1) × 100%**

## Present Value
**PV = A / (1 + r/n)^(nt)**

## Annuity Formula for Future Value
**FV = PMT × [((1 + r/n)^(nt) - 1) / (r/n)]**

## Annuity Formula for Payment Amounts
**PMT = FV × [r/n / ((1 + r/n)^(nt) - 1)]**

## Regular Payment Formula for Fixed Installment Loans
**PMT = (P × r/n) / (1 - (1 + r/n)^(-nt))**

## Maximum Purchase Price Formula
**maximum purchase price = PMT × [(1 - (1 + r/n)^(-nt)) / (r/n)]**

## Number of Fixed Payments Required to Pay Off Credit Card Debt
**R = -log(1 - (r/n)(A/PMT)) / log(1 + r/n)**
