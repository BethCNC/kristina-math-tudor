# MAT 143 Week 1 Attendance Assignment Sample

## Question Types You Can Expect:

### Deductive vs Inductive Reasoning
**Example:** Taylor plays football and has caught 24 out of 56 targets so far this season. So, he is expected to catch 6 out of 14 targets in tonight's game.
**Answer:** Inductive (making a prediction based on past performance)

### Pattern Recognition
**Example:** Given the sequence: 288, 144, 72, 36, ...
- **Pattern:** To find the next number, divide the previous number by 2
- **Next terms:** 18, 9
- **Type:** Geometric sequence

### Sequence Types
- **Arithmetic:** Constant difference between terms (add same number each time)
- **Geometric:** Constant ratio between terms (multiply/divide by same number each time)
- **Neither:** Pattern that doesn't fit arithmetic or geometric rules

## Study Tips:
1. Look for what's being added, subtracted, multiplied, or divided
2. Check if the pattern is consistent throughout the sequence  
3. Write out your reasoning in complete sentences
4. Always identify the sequence type (arithmetic, geometric, or neither)
