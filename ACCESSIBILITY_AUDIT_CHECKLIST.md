## Known Issues / Future Improvements

### Minor Issues
- [ ] Chapter 5 cover image needs creation
- [ ] Some chapter pages need full content update (currently using mixed old/new styles)

5. **Dark Mode Toggle**: Add manual dark mode switch (currently auto-detects)
6. **Course Progress Animation**: Animate circular progress ring on profile

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Font Subsetting**: Load only required character sets
2. **Critical CSS**: Inline critical styles for above-the-fold content
3. **Image Optimization**: Convert placeholder images to WebP
4. **Bundle Splitting**: Separate critical vs non-critical JavaScript
5. **Lazy Loading**: Implement for below-the-fold content
