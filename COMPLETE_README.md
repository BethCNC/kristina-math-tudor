## 🎯 **Missing Chapters Explained**

**Q: What about Chapters 2, 3, 8, 9, 12?**
**A:** These chapters aren't part of MAT 143! The course only covers:
- Chapters 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 13

This is intentional - MAT 143 focuses on practical quantitative literacy topics, not sequential chapter coverage.
