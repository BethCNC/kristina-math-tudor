## ⚠️ What Needs Attention

### 1. **English Resource Pages - INCOMPLETE** ⚠️

**Files Still Using Old CSS (`globals.css`):**
- ⚠️ `english/citation-guide.html`
- ⚠️ `english/mla-basics.html`
- ⚠️ `english/plagiarism.html`
- ⚠️ `english/works-cited.html`
- ⚠️ `english/critical-thinking.html`

**Impact:**
- Inconsistent user experience when navigating to these pages
- Different navigation patterns
- Old color schemes and typography
- Breaks visual continuity

**Recommendation:** Update these 5 pages to use `professional-academic.css` and standard header/navigation template.

### 2. **CSS File Cleanup - PARTIALLY COMPLETE** ⚠️

**Current State:**
- ✅ Archived `globals-new.css` and `elearning-complete.css`
- ✅ Single source of truth: `professional-academic.css`
- ⚠️ Still have 18 CSS files in `src/styles/` directory
- ⚠️ Old CSS files (`globals.css`, `design-system.css`, etc.) still present

**Files to Consider Archiving:**
```
src/styles/
├── globals.css                    ⚠️ Still used by English resource pages
├── design-system.css              ⚠️ Old system, archive
├── award-winning-design.css       ⚠️ Superseded, archive
├── adhd-friendly.css              ✅ Keep (features used)
├── accessibility.css              ✅ Keep (important)
├── tailwind-design-system.css     ⚠️ Old, archive
├── tokens-implementation.css      ⚠️ Old, archive
├── colors-elearning.css           ⚠️ Superseded, archive
├── typography-inter.css           ⚠️ Superseded, archive
├── design-system-elearning.css    ⚠️ Superseded, archive
└── components-*.css               ⚠️ Modular files, superseded
```

**Recommendation:** 
1. Update English resource pages to use `professional-academic.css`
2. Archive old CSS files to `_archived/old-css/`
3. Keep only: `professional-academic.css`, `accessibility.css`, `adhd-friendly.css`, `animations.css`

### 3. **Essay 1 & 2 Pages - NOT UPDATED** ⚠️

**Files:**
- ⚠️ `english/essay-1-guide.html`
- ⚠️ `english/essay-2-guide.html`
- ⚠️ `english/essay-3-rubric.html` (separate from guide)
- ⚠️ `english/essay-4-rubric.html` (separate from guide)

**Status:**
- These essays are already completed (2/4 progress)
- Lower priority than Essay 3 & 4
- Still using old design system

**Recommendation:** Update for consistency, but lower priority since essays are completed.

### 4. **Chapters 11 & 13 - MINIMAL UPDATES** ⚠️

**Current State:**
- ✅ Updated stylesheet reference to `professional-academic.css`
- ⚠️ Still using old HTML structure and Tailwind classes
- ⚠️ Don't match professional template used in other chapters
