# MAT 143 Unit 4 Formula Sheet - Statistics

## Z-Score Formula
**z = (data - mean) / standard deviation**

### For Populations:
**z = (x - μ) / σ**
- x = data value
- μ = population mean
- σ = population standard deviation

### For Samples:
**z = (x - x̄) / s**
- x = data value
- x̄ = sample mean
- s = sample standard deviation

## Empirical Rule (68-95-99.7 Rule)
For normally distributed data:
- 68% of data falls within 1 standard deviation of the mean
- 95% of data falls within 2 standard deviations of the mean
- 99.7% of data falls within 3 standard deviations of the mean

## Probability
**P(event) = favorable outcomes / total outcomes**

**Expected Value: E(X) = Σ(x × P(x))**
