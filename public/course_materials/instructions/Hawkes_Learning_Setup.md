# Setting Up Hawkes Learning for MAT 143

## IMPORTANT: Complete EVA First!
The Hawkes Learning button will NOT appear on your Brightspace page until the EVA (Enrollment Verification Activity) is completed.

## Setup Steps:

## For Homework Success:
- Complete problems until you see: "Congratulations! You've Mastered this lesson"
- You get either 100% (mastery) or 0% (not mastered) - no partial credit
- Use hints when stuck, but focus on understanding
- Return to Hawkes Learning tab in Brightspace for all assignments

## Need Help?
- No access code needed - it's included in your tuition
- If you have issues, contact your instructor immediately
