## üìù FINAL NOTES

**What's Working:**
This app is **excellent** for tracking major assessments (tests and essays). The Next Due widget is a **game-changer** for ADHD support - seeing the countdown on every page creates appropriate urgency without panic.

**What's Missing:**
The app doesn't yet track **Hawkes Learning assignments** (20% of MAT 143 grade), which is a critical gap since these are due at the same time as tests and easy to forget.

**Priority Fix:**
Add Hawkes Learning deadlines to the app - specifically the **Nov 3 deadline for Chapters 6 & 7** which is due the SAME DAY as Test 3 starts. This is a recipe for disaster if not prominently displayed.

**For Student Right Now:**
- ‚úÖ Test 3 prep: Use chapter-6.html and chapter-7.html
- ‚úÖ Essay 3 prep: Use english/essay-3-guide.html
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **MANUALLY CHECK HAWKES** - Due Nov 3!
- ‚úÖ Use deadlines.html for full semester view

---

**Status:** App is **highly functional** and **visually excellent**. With Hawkes tracking added, it becomes **complete and foolproof** for student success. 

**Deployed:** All changes live on Vercel.
