# Revising & Editing Process 

![a woman working on the computer](https://owl.excelsior.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/computer-1185626_1920.jpg)Revision and editing are both important parts of the writing process, yet many students skip revision and don’t spend enough time editing. It’s important to remember that these steps are separate and that each step takes time. The following pages will help you develop strong revision and editing strategies for your writing process. 

## Revision 

The revision process is an essential aspect of writing and one that you should build in time for before submitting your written work. 

### Revision means to “re-see” the piece of writing. 

It isn’t just proofreading your paper or correcting grammar, punctuation, or spelling errors. Revision is stepping back and looking at your paper as a whole and seeing if you are effectively saying what you intend to say. It is giving your paper a thorough look to see how you can make it stronger. Your goal should always be to write clearly, concisely, and in an engaging way. 

One way to go about re-seeing your writing is to do it in three stages. Many people skip the first stage, but looking at the big picture is crucial in making sure you have a well-developed essay that expresses your ideas.
