### Plagiarism and Citations 

Students today are overwhelmed with plagiarism information. Research shows that students usually deliberately commit plagiarism, rather than acting from ignorance or misunderstanding.

- [**PowerPoint - plagiarism and citations - EFL ](https://researchguides.cpcc.edu/ld.php?content_id=37486834)

- [Plagiarism Libguide ](https://researchguides.cpcc.edu/plagiarism)A student-facing resource to help students understand quoting, summarizing, and paraphrasing. 

Have students construct their own citation from a book in the library. 

I use this in my EFL classes to mixed results. However, EFL and core students are now hearing about plagiarism all day long every day, so there's less of a need for this kind of presentation. Deliver only if asked.- **Christy **
