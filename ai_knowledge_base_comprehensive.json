So, he is expected to catch 6 out of 14 targets in tonight's game. Answer: Inductive (making a prediction based on past performance) Pattern Recognition Example: Given the sequence: 288, 144, 72, 36, ... - Pattern: To find the next number, divide the previous number by 2 - Next terms: 18, 9 - Type: Geometric sequence Sequence Types Arithmetic: Constant difference between terms (add same number each time) Geometric: Constant ratio between terms (multiply/divide by same number each time) Neither: Pattern that doesn't fit arithmetic or geometric rules Study Tips: Look for what's being added, subtracted, multiplied, or divided Check if the pattern is consistent throughout the sequence Write out your reasoning in complete sentences Always identify the sequence type (arithmetic, geometric, or neither) &copy; 2025 Kristina's Academic Success Dashboard.
